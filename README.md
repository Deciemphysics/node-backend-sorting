# node-backend-sorting
A container for a node project to process through a file system and count various amounts of words.

To run, simple use `node read.js`. Project guidelines specifically state to use the folder included, and as such I did not have the project allow for variable input of the default folder. Such a thing could be implemented, but was outside the scope of this project.
